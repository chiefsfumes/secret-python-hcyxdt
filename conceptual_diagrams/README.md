# Conceptual Diagrams for Risk Analysis System

This folder contains detailed process flows for the risk analysis system, with a focus on the translation from abstract risk metrics to concrete business impacts.

## Diagram Overview

1. **Overall Sequence Flow** (1_overall_sequence.md)
   - High-level process flow
   - Key system components
   - New translation layer highlight

2. **Business Impact Translation** (2_business_impact_translation.md)
   - Translation mechanism details
   - Category-specific matrices
   - Business metric mapping

3. **Cascade Analysis** (3_cascade_analysis.md)
   - Cascade tree building
   - Propagation mechanics
   - Time adjustments

4. **Business Metrics Propagation** (4_business_metrics_propagation.md)
   - Metric-specific propagation
   - Time decay effects
   - Impact combination

5. **Scenario Adjustment** (5_scenario_adjustment.md)
   - Scenario-specific impacts
   - Category adjustments
   - Business metric adaptation

6. **Monte Carlo Simulation** (6_monte_carlo_simulation.md)
   - Parameter distributions
   - Business metric simulation
   - Risk metric calculation
   - Stress testing

7. **Systemic Risk Analysis** (7_systemic_risk_analysis.md)
   - Network analysis
   - Cross-entity impacts
