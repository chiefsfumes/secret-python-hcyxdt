## Bringing It All Together

The power of this system lies in its comprehensiveness. We're not just assessing risks - we're mapping their business impacts, tracking their propagation, testing different futures, and understanding system-wide vulnerabilities.

Most importantly, we're speaking the language of business. Every risk assessment ultimately translates into impacts on revenue, costs, market share, and operations. This makes the analysis actionable and relevant for decision-makers.

It's a living system that can be updated as we learn more, as conditions change, and as new risks emerge. It helps us not just understand climate risks, but actively manage them in a business context.
