## The Big Picture

Imagine we're building a sophisticated radar system for climate risks. But instead of just detecting risks, we're tracking how they ripple through a business like waves in a pond. 

We start with basic risk assessments - likelihood and impact scores. But these are just the surface. The real magic happens when we map out how these risks interact, how they evolve over time, and most importantly, how they translate into real business impacts.

Think of it as a three-dimensional chess game. On one level, we have the raw risks. On another, we have business metrics like revenue and costs. And on the third, we have different future scenarios playing out. Our job is to connect all these dots in a meaningful way.
