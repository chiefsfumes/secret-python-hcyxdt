## The Ripple Effect

Now comes the fascinating part - how risks cascade through the system. Imagine dropping stones in a pond. Each risk creates ripples that interact with others in complex ways.

We've built a sophisticated engine that tracks these cascades. It considers how impacts propagate through time, how different business metrics influence each other, and how the strength of these effects decays over distance.

The really clever bit? We account for time delays. A supply chain disruption might hit your operations immediately, but the impact on market share could take months to materialize. Our system tracks all these temporal relationships.
