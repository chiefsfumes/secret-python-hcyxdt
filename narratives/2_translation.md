## From Abstract to Concrete

The most crucial innovation in our system is the translation layer. Think of it as a Rosetta Stone that converts abstract risk scores into concrete business impacts.

We've created detailed impact matrices for different risk categories. Physical risks might directly hit your revenue through disrupted operations. Transition risks could squeeze your margins through increased costs. Nature-related risks might erode your market share over time.

Each risk category speaks a different language of impact. A 0.8 impact score means something very different for an extreme weather event versus a policy change. Our translation matrices capture these nuances, giving us a clear picture of what each risk means in business terms.
