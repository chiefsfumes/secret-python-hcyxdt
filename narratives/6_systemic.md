## The Big Picture View

Finally, we step back and look at the whole system. Where are the concentrations of risk? How stable is our network? Where are the critical intervention points?

This systemic view helps identify vulnerabilities that might not be obvious when looking at individual risks. Maybe there's a cluster of risks that could create a perfect storm. Or perhaps there's a critical node in our network that needs extra attention.

The beauty of this approach is that it combines bottom-up analysis (individual risks and their cascades) with top-down assessment (system stability and concentration). It gives us both the forest and the trees.
