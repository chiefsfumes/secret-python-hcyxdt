## Playing Out Different Futures

Here's where it gets really interesting. We take all these relationships we've mapped and play them out under different future scenarios.

In a Net Zero 2050 world, physical risks might be lower, but transition risks could spike early. In a Delayed Transition scenario, it's the opposite - physical risks ramp up while transition impacts hit harder later.

Our system adjusts all the business impacts and cascade effects based on these scenarios. It's like running thousands of simulations of possible futures, each with its own internal logic and relationships.
