## Embracing Uncertainty

But we don't just run single scenarios. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we explore the full range of possibilities within each scenario.

Think of it as stress-testing our business impact predictions. What if the revenue impact is 20% worse than we thought? What if costs rise faster? What if market share erodes more slowly?

This gives us confidence intervals, Value at Risk metrics, and a much better understanding of our uncertainty. It helps identify which impacts we're most certain about and where we need more information.
